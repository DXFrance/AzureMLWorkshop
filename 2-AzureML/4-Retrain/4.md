# retrain and republish a model from Python code

## introduction

The goal of this example is to take a simple model that defines the price based (label) on surface (1 feature), 
and update it programmatically in Python by giving it prices that were raised by 10% for the same surfaces.
Once the performance of the retrained model has been evaluated, Python code updates the production endpoint of the web service 
so that it reflect the +10% update on prices.

## datasets

The 2 files are in the `datasets` folder. Here are the first lines for both: 

NB: the `id` field is ignored by the model.

`immo.csv` (uploaded as `immo170301a.csv` in the picture below): 

```
id,surface,prix
1,25,30700
2,26,31634
3,27,32568
4,28,33502
5,29,34436
6,30,35370
7,31,36304
8,32,37238
9,33,38172
10,34,39106
(...)
```


`immo-plus-10-percent.csv`: 

```
id,surface,prix
277,25,33770
278,26,34797.4
279,27,35824.8
280,28,36852.2
281,29,37879.6
282,30,38907
283,31,39934.4

285,33,41989.2
286,34,43016.6

```

## create the model in Azure ML Studio, expose as a web service

The model is already available from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery. You can copy it in your own environment from the following URL: 
<https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/immo-simple-170301-starting-experiment-1>

It looks like this: 

![](img/s001.png)

You can see that the dataset is synthetic!
![](img/s002.png)


Run the experiment 

The performance is good ;-)
![](img/s003.png)

We'll take the left model (the linear regresssion) and make a predictive experiment.
![](img/s005.png)

Modify the experiment so that it looks like this: 
![](img/s004.png)

- the `Select Columns in Dataset` removes the label so that the Web Service won't take it as an input.
- the web service input points to the entry of the `Score Model`

Run the experiment, deploy the web service.

go to `New Web Services Experience`
![](img/s006.png)

then add a new endpoint: 
![](img/s007.png)

![](img/s008.png)

![](img/s009.png)

![](img/s010.png)

![](img/s011.png)

then copy a number of elements you will need later on: 

![](img/s012.png)

![](img/s013.png)

Copy the following elements (the names in quotes will be the one we'll use later on): 

"mykey": 
![](img/s014.png)

"myurl": 
![](img/s015.png)

![](img/s016.png)

![](img/s017.png)

![](img/s018.png)

"mykey_prod":
![](img/s019.png)

"myurl_prod":
![](img/s020.png)

"myurl_patch_prod": 
![](img/s021.png)

Then, go back to the experiment itself, in order to create a training web service.

NB:  this is `Training experiment` tab.


Add a Web Service input and two web service outputs as described in the picture. 
![](img/s022.png)

NB: the web service output 1 must be named `output1` and the other web service output must be named `output2`.

Run

Deploy the web service

![](img/s023.png)

get the key and the url:

![](img/s024.png)

![](img/s025.png)

copy "mykey_retrain":
![](img/s026.png)

copy "myurl_retrain":
![](img/s027.png)

## from a Python notebook (Jupyter): test, retrain, get the result, update, test

create a new Python 2 notebook. 

![](img/n001.png)

![](img/n002.png)

Copy and paste the cells from the [retrain notebook](retrain_notebook.md)

run the notebook. You should see the results raised by 10%.
